Introduction
-----------
**Simplify complex process automation with a flexible, high-performance framework.**

This library tackles the challenges of building reliable, scalable workflows by
providing a clear separation between coordination and execution. It uses a declarative DSL,
**Pointy-Lang**, to model your pipelines while managing the underlying complexity of concurrency,
state, and task dependencies.

Build resilient automation that can handle anything from simple data processing to distributed, event-driven systems.
