# Pointy Language Tutorial

Pointy Language is a powerful domain-specific language (DSL) for creating event-based workflows. This tutorial will guide you from basic concepts to advanced workflows using Pointy Language's intuitive arrow-based syntax.

## 1. Introduction to Pointy Language

Pointy Language uses arrows and operators to represent event flow, making it easy to visualize and define workflows. Its primary purpose is to model sequences of operations, conditional branching, parallel execution, and result piping.

### Core Features:
- Sequential execution of events
- Parallel processing
- Conditional branching based on success/failure
- Result piping between events
- Retry mechanisms for handling failures

## 2. Basic Syntax and Operators

### Single Events
The most basic element in Pointy Language is a single event, represented by a name:

```
A    # This defines a single event named A
```

Events are units of work that get executed as part of your workflow.

### Directional Operator (->)
The arrow operator defines sequential flow between events:

```
A -> B    # Execute event A, then execute event B
```

This indicates that event B will only start after event A has completed.

### Parallel Operator (||)
The parallel operator runs events concurrently:

```
A || B    # Execute event A and event B in parallel
```

Both events start at the same time and run independently.

### Pipe Result Operator (|->)
This operator passes the output from one event as input to another:

```
A |-> B    # The result of event A becomes the input for event B
```

This is useful when one event depends on data produced by another.

### Conditional Branching
Pointy Language uses descriptors (numbers) to define different execution paths:

```
A -> B (0 -> C, 1 -> D)
```

In this example:
- If B fails (descriptor 0), execute C
- If B succeeds (descriptor 1), execute D

### Retry Operator (*)
The asterisk operator defines retry behavior for events:

```
A * 3    # Retry event A up to 3 times if it fails
```

This increases reliability by automatically retrying failed events.

## 3. Building Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple workflow for processing a document:

```
ReceiveDocument -> ValidateFormat (
    0 -> NotifyFormatError,
    1 -> ExtractData
) -> SaveToDatabase (
    0 -> LogDatabaseError,
    1 -> SendConfirmation
)
```

This workflow:
1. Receives a document
2. Validates its format
3. On valid format, extracts data; otherwise notifies of an error
4. Attempts to save to a database
5. On successful save, sends confirmation; otherwise logs the error

## 4. Intermediate Concepts

### Combining Parallel and Sequential Operations

You can mix parallel operations with sequential ones:

```
A -> (B || C) -> D
```

This executes A first, then B and C in parallel, and finally D after both B and C complete.

### Piping Results from Parallel Operations

Results from parallel operations can be piped to subsequent events:

```
(A || B) |-> C
```

Here, the results of both A and B are combined and passed to C.

### Multiple Branches with Sink

Create complex decision trees with multiple branches that reunite:

```
A (0 -> B, 1 -> C) -> D
```

This executes A, then either B (if A fails) or C (if A succeeds), and finally D regardless of which branch was taken.

## 5. Advanced Workflows

### Error Handling with Result Piping

```
ProcessOrder -> ValidatePayment (
    0 |-> LogPaymentError -> NotifyCustomer,
    1 -> FulfillOrder
)
```

This workflow pipes error information from a failed validation directly to the logging step.

### Custom Descriptors

Pointy Language allows descriptors 3-9 for user-defined conditions:

```
AnalyzeData -> EvaluateResults (
    0 -> HandleError,
    1 -> ProcessSuccess,
    3 -> ReviewManually  # Custom condition for cases requiring human review
)
```

### Complex Nested Workflow

Let's build a more sophisticated order processing workflow:

```
ReceiveOrder -> ValidateInventory (
    0 -> NotifyOutOfStock |-> SuggestAlternatives,
    1 -> ProcessPayment (
        0 -> RefundCustomer,
        1 -> (PrepareShipment || GenerateInvoice) |-> NotifyWarehouse
    )
) -> UpdateOrderStatus * 3
```

This workflow:
1. Validates inventory availability
2. Handles out-of-stock situations with notifications and suggestions
3. Processes payment when items are available
4. On payment success, prepares shipment and generates invoice in parallel
5. Notifies the warehouse with combined shipment and invoice data
6. Updates order status with retry capability (up to 3 attempts)

## 6. Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
Use descriptive event names that clearly indicate the action being performed.

### Error Handling
Always define paths for both success and failure cases to ensure robust workflows.

### Modularization
Break complex workflows into smaller, reusable components.

### Documentation
Comment complex sections of your workflow to explain decision points and conditions.

## 7. Practical Example: Customer Onboarding Workflow

```
ReceiveApplication -> ValidateInformation * 2 (
    0 -> RequestCorrections |-> NotifyApplicant,
    1 -> PerformCreditCheck (
        0 -> (AssessRisk || OfferLimitedServices) |-> NotifyDecision,
        1 -> (CreateAccount || PrepareWelcomePackage || SetupAutopay) |-> ActivateServices
    )
) -> SendConfirmationEmail (
    0 -> LogEmailFailure -> AttemptSMS,
    1 -> ScheduleFollowUp
)
```

This comprehensive workflow handles a new customer application with:
- Information validation with retry capability
- Credit check with different paths based on results
- Parallel processes for account setup
- Fallback communication methods
- Follow-up scheduling

## 8. Conclusion

Pointy Language provides an elegant solution for defining complex workflows with its intuitive arrow-based syntax. By combining sequential operations, parallel processing, conditional branching, and result piping, you can create sophisticated event-based systems that handle both happy paths and error conditions seamlessly.

As you become more familiar with Pointy Language, you'll find it increasingly natural to express even the most complex business processes in this concise and visual format.
